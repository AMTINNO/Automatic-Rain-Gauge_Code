# Automatic-Rain-Gauge
This project was developed during the first six month of the Computer Science bachelor degree. And it works detecting the amount of rain that fell in a given period of time (counting from the moment it started raining).

The idea is to store this data and using an API and check the information given by APAC, a government department that make predictions about rain, and help people that lives in risk areas prevent losses due to landslides to know when they are running into a dangerous situation because of the amount of rain. It will work with a mobile app.
